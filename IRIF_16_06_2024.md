**Programme**

* **Nicolas Waldburger** (INRIA) : *Parameterized Broadcast Networks with Registers* 

We consider the parameterized verification of networks of agents which communicate through unreliable broadcasts. In this model, agents have local registers whose values are unordered and initially distinct and may therefore be thought of as identifiers. When an agent broadcasts a message, it appends to the message the value stored in one of its registers. Upon reception, an agent can store the received value or test it for equality against one of its own registers. We consider the coverability problem, where one asks whether a given state of the system may be reached by at least one agent. We establish that this problem is decidable, although non-primitive recursive. We contrast this with the undecidability of the closely related target problem where all agents must synchronize on a given state. On the other hand, we show that the coverability problem is NP-complete when each agent only has one register.

* **Igor Walukiewicz** (LABRI) : *Characterizing consensus in the Heard-Of model*

The Heard-Of model is a simple and relatively expressive model of distributed computation. Because  of this, it has gained a considerable attention of the verification community. We give a characterization of all algorithms solving consensus in a fragment of this model. The fragment is big enough to cover  many prominent consensus algorithms. The characterization is purely syntactic: it is expressed in terms of some conditions on the text of the algorithm. Joint work with A. R. Balasubramanian


* **Radu Iosif** (VERIMAG) : *Self-Adapting Networks* 

We introduce a formal model to reason about the behaviors of self-adapting (reconfigurable) networks. The second part of the talk introduces the Separation Logic of Relations (SLR), a resource logic used to specify infinite sets of network configurations and compares the expressivity of this logic to that of well-established hypergraph description logics, such as (Monadic) Second Order logic. If time allows, we present some recent advances in the definition of a general fragment of SLR with decidable validity (universality) and entailment (inclusion) problems. Such a fragment is key to obtaining (push-button) verification algorithms for checking the correctness of self-adapting networks. 

* **Michael Raskin** (LABRI) : *Getting readable proofs for replicated systems from automated provers*

The most powerful general systems for automatic search of rigorous proofs are probably First-Order Automated Theorem Provers. In this talk I will give an overview of a few papers (joint work with Christoph Welzel and Javier Esparza) where we have used FO ATPs for verification of parametric systems. The core of the approach is guessing which form of general invariants can be useful, then trying to prove such generalisations for finite-instance invariants.

* **Nathalie Bertrand** (INRIA) : *TBA*
