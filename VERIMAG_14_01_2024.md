9h30-10h00 **Michael Raskin** (LABRI): *Modular Population Protocols*

Population protocols are a model of distributed computation intended
for the study of networks of independent computing agents with dynamic
communication structure. Each agent has a finite number of states, and
communication opportunities occur nondeterministically, allowing the
agents involved changing their states based on each other's
states. Population protocols are often studied in terms of reaching a
consensus on whether the input configuration satisfied some predicate.
A desirable property of a computation model is modularity, the ability
to combine existing simpler computations in a straightforward way. In
the present paper we present a more general notion of functionality
implemented by a population protocol in terms of multisets of inputs
and outputs. This notion allows to design multiphase protocols as
combinations of independently defined phases. The additional
generality also increases the range of behaviours that can be captured
in applications (e.g. maintaining the role distribution in a fleet of
servers).  We show that the composition of protocols can be performed
in a uniform mechanical way, and that the expressive power is
essentially semilinear, similar to the predicate expressive power in
the original population protocol setting.

10h00-10h30 **Nicolas Waldburger** (IRISA): *Verification of Population Protocols with Unordered Data*

Population protocols are a well-studied model of distributed
computation in which a group of anonymous finite-state agents
communicates via pairwise interactions. Together they decide whether
their initial configuration, i. e., the initial distribution of agents
in the states, satisfies a property. As an extension in order to
express properties of multisets over an infinite data domain, Blondin
and Ladouceur (ICALP’23) introduced population protocols with
unordered data (PPUD). In PPUD, each agent carries a fixed data value,
and the interactions between agents depend on whether their data are
equal or not.  Blondin and Ladouceur also identified the interesting
subclass of immediate observation PPUD (IOPPUD), where in every
transition one of the two agents remains passive and does not move,
and they characterised its expressive power.  We study the
decidability and complexity of formally verifying these protocols.
The main verification problem for population protocols is
well-specification, that is, checking whether the given PPUD computes
some function. We show that well-specification is undecidable in
general.  By contrast, for IOPPUD, we exhibit a large yet natural
class of problems, which includes well-specification among other
classic problems, and establish that these problems are in
ExpSpace. We also provide a lower complexity bound, namely
coNExpTime-hardness.

10h30-11h00 **Coffee break**

11h00-11h30 **Romain Delpy** (LABRI): *An automata-based approach for synchronizable mailbox communication*

We revisit finite-state communicating systems with round-based
communication under mailbox semantics. Mailboxes correspond to one
FIFO buffer per process (instead of one buffer per pair of processes
in peer-to-peer systems). Round-based communication corresponds to
sequences of rounds in which processes can first send messages, then
only receive (and receives must be in the same round as their
sends). A system is called synchronizable if every execution can be
re-scheduled into an equivalent execution that is a sequence of
rounds. Previous work mostly considered the setting where rounds have
fixed size. Our main contribution shows that the problem whether a
mailbox communication system complies with the round-based policy,
with no size limitation on rounds, is Pspace-complete. For this we use
a novel automata-based approach, that also allows to determine the
precise complexity (Pspace) of several questions considered in
previous literature.

11h30-12h00 **Lucie Guillou** (IRIF): *Reachability in Wait-Only Broadcast Networks*

In this ongoing work, we investigate networks composed of an unbounded
number of agents that communicate via broadcasts. All agents execute
the same protocol, described as a finite-state machine. The
reachability problem asks whether, given a protocol and a target
state, there exists a number of agents and a sequence of actions that
leads to a configuration where all agents are in the specified target
state. This problem is known to be undecidable in the general
case. However, we focus on Wait-Only protocols, where no state allows
an agent to both broadcast and receive messages. Under this
restriction, we show that the reachability problem becomes decidable,
though it is as hard as the reachability problem for Petri nets.  This
is joint work with Arnaud Sangnier and Tali Sznajder.

12h00-13h30 **Lunch break**

13h30-14h00 **Igor Walukiewicz** (LABRI): *Distributed race detection*

We aim to develop methods for distributed monitoring of program executions to
detect concurrency errors at runtime. The goal is to create a technique that can instrument
program code to report potential violations of important consistency rules. Our
focus is on ensuring that the methods have minimal impact on the program’s
original performance, which is why the distributed nature of the monitoring
process is crucial. The objective is not to just report if an error happened,
but if an error could happen under a different scheduling of the observed
execution. This is very powerful as there may be exponentially many schedulings
of the same execution, and an error can appear only in particular corner cases. 
We will present a simple construction of such a distributed monitor for races,
discuss its shortcomings, and sketch a more efficient solution. 

14h00-14h30 **Corto Mascle** (LABRI): *Verification of dynamic systems with locks and variables*

We study the verification of distributed systems where processes have
three kinds of operations: taking and releasing locks, reading and
writing in shared variables and spawning other processes.  While this
problem is in general undecidable, we present techniques to decide it
in restricted cases with a tree automata-based construction, as well
as ongoing work on an extension to synthesis.

14h30-14h45 **Coffee break**

14h45-15h15 **Neven Villani** (VERIMAG): *Counting Abstraction for the Verification of Structured Parameterized Networks*

We present a technique to automatically prove safety properties of a
class of (infinite) families of networks, which includes heterogeneous
inductive architectures given by network grammars, and synchronization
between processes in the form of bounded rendezvous. We tackle the
verification problem by computing a reduction from the language of the
network grammar (an infinite family of Petri Nets) to a finite number
of instances.  The safety property of the system, expressed as a
coverability problem, is decidable on the reduced system by automated
tools.

15h15-15h45 **Mathieu Laurent** (IRISA): *Towards Efficient Verification of Parallel Applications with Mc SimGrid*

Assessing the correctness of distributed and parallel applications is
notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the concurrent behaviors and the
difficulty to reproduce bugs. In this context, Dynamic Partial Order Reduction
(DPOR) techniques have proved successful in exploiting concurrency to verify
applications without exploring all their behaviors. However, they may lack of
efficiency when tracking non-systematic bugs of real size applications. In this
paper, we propose two adaptations of the Optimal Dynamic Partial Order (ODPOR)
algorithm with a particular focus on bug finding and explanation. The first
algorithm proposes an out-of-order version called BeFS ODPOR which purpose is to
avoid being stuck in uninteresting large parts of the state space. Once a bug is
found, the second adaptation takes advantage of ODPOR principles to efficiently
find the origins of the bug. Joint work with Thierry Jéron and Martin Quinson.
