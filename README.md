## Abstract
Applications of distributed systems are omnipresent. They allow sharing resources and data. They are used to coordinate activities across multiple nodes, as in geographically distributed systems. Furthermore, they increase the resilience of systems through fault tolerance, availability, and recovery mechanisms. Designing, understanding, and validating distributed systems is challenging because of the huge number of interactions between components, some potentially leading to unpredictable scenarios. Early detection of design errors is not only crucial for financial reasons, but it is often the only feasible way to find critical errors. The methods for ensuring the correctness of distributed systems are not yet mature. This is particularly the case for the **mechanized reasoning methods** that we propose to develop in this project.
